# jobthing is a module that allows for background execution of a task, and
# getting status of that task.  The ultimate goal is to allow ajaxyness
# of GUI apps using Func, and also for extremely long running tasks that
# we don't want to block on as called by scripts using the FunC API.  The
# CLI should not use this.
