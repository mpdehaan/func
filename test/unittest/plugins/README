python nosetest module.

To install, run "easy_install .", and it should install
as a nosetest plugin egg. To use, 




  --with-funccoverage   Enable plugin FuncCoverage:  If you have Ned
                        Batchelder's coverage module installed, you may
                        activate a coverage report. The coverage report will
                        cover any python source module imported after the
                        start of the test run, excluding modules that match
                        testMatch. If you want to include those modules too,
                        use the --cover-tests switch, or set the
                        NOSE_COVER_TESTS environment variable to a true value.
                        To restrict the coverage report to modules from a
                        particular package or packages, use the --cover-
                        packages switch or the NOSE_COVER_PACKAGES environment
                        variable.  [NOSE_WITH_FUNCCOVERAGE]
  --func-cover-package=COVER_PACKAGES
                        Restrict coverage output to selected packages
                        [FUNC_NOSE_COVER_PACKAGE]
  --func-cover-erase    Erase previously collected coverage statistics before
                        run
  --func-cover-tests    Include test modules in coverage report
                        [FUNC_NOSE_COVER_TESTS]
  --func-cover-annotate
                        write out annotated files[FUNC_NOSE_COVER_ANNOTATE]
  --func-cover-dir=COVER_DIR
                        directory to write data to[FUNC_NOSE_COVER_DIR]
  --func-cover-inclusive
                        Include all python files under working directory in
                        coverage report.  Useful for discovering holes in test
                        coverage if not all files are imported by the test
                        suite. [FUNC_NOSE_COVER_INCLUSIVE]

Example:

	
 nosetests --with-funccoverage --func-cover-dir data/ --func-cover-annotate --func-cover-erase --func-cover-package func -v -d -s test_client.py:TestTest

To generate html'ified coverage reports, run "cover_to_html.py data/ html" from the unittest dir
